My Messager Protocol v1
----------------------------

1. The ZRQM packet structure

The ZRQM packet structure is as follows:

     <------- 4B -------><------- 4B -------><---2B--->
    +-------------------+-------------------+---------+
    |   Z   R   Q   M   |      version      | pkt_len |
    +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
    | service |      status       |    session_id     |
    +---------+-------------------+-------------------+
    |                                                 |
    :                    D A T A                      :
    |                   0 - 65535*                    |
    +-------------------------------------------------+

ZRQM    - The first four bytes of all packets are always ZRQM - the 
          protocol name.

version - The next four bytes are for the protocol version number.
          For version 1, these are 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00
          NOTE: The last three bytes of this may just be padding bytes.

pkt_len - A two byte value, in network byte order, stating how many bytes 
          are in the _data_ section of the packet.  In practice, this 
          value does not exceed about 1000.

service - This is an opcode that tells the client/server what kind of 
          service is requested/being responded to.  There are 45 known 
          services.  See the services section of this document for a 
          full listing.

status  - In case of a response from the server, indicates the status
          of the request (success/failure/etc.).  For a request, it is 0 
          in most cases, except for packets that set the user's status 
          (set status, typing notify, etc.)

session - The session id is used primarily when connecting through a HTTP 
id        proxy.  It is set in all cases, but has no effect in a direct 
          connection.  When the client sends the first packet, it is 0, 
          the server responds with a session id that is used by the client 
          and the server in all further packets.  The server may change 
          the session id, in which case the client must use the new 
          session id henceforth.

DATA    - The data section is pkt_len bytes long and consists of a series 
          of key/value pairs.  All keys are numeric strings.  The packet 
          contains their numeric values in the ASCII character set.  e.g.
          1 == 0x31, 21 == 0x32 0x31

          The maximum number of digits in a key is unknown, although keys 
          of up to three digits have been seen.

          Every key and value is terminated by a two byte sequence of 
          0xc0 0x80.  Some keys may have empty values.

          The actual keys sent, and their meanings depend on the service
          in use.

          e.g. The packet data to send an instant message looks like this:

          0x30 0xc080 yahoo_id 0xc080 0x31 0xc080 active_id 0xc080 0x35 
          0xc080 recipient_id 0xc080 0x3134 0xc080 message_text 0xc080

          The 0xc080 byte sequence is a separator.  The values 0x30, 0x31, 
          0x35 and 0x3134 are the keys.  Convert them to their ASCII 
          equivalents and you get 0, 1, 5, 14  (0x3134 == 0x31 0x34)


2. Services

There are 45 known services at the moment, although more may exist.  All 
known services are listed below along with the hex values that they 
correspond to.  Any service without a hex value is one more than the 
previous value.

        ZRQ_SERVICE_PEERTOPEER       = 0x4f
        ZRQ_SERVICE_AUTHRESP         = 0x54
        ZRQ_SERVICE_LIST             = 0x55

        ZRQ_SERVICE_REMBUDDY         = 0x84
        ZRQ_SERVICE_IGNORECONTACT    = 0x85
        ZRQ_SERVICE_REJECTCONTACT    = 0x86

Most of the service codes should be self explanatory.  Those that aren't 
are listed here:

IDACT/IDDEACT - activate/deactivate an identity
NOTIFY        - typing/game notification
FILETRASNFER  - transfer a file using the yahoo filetransfer server as an 
                intermediate
P2PFILEXFER   - transfer a file between two peers, yahoo server not used
PEERTOPEER    - check if peer to peer connections are possible
AUTH          - Send initial login packet (username), response contains 
                challenge string
AUTHRESP      - Send response to challenge string, or, if received from 
                server, contains reason for login failure
LOGON/LOGOFF  - a buddy logged in/out


3. Status codes

The status code is a four byte value.  Most status codes are two bytes 
long.  The status codes (in decimal except for offline and typing) are:

        ZRQ_STATUS_AVAILABLE    = 0
        ZRQ_STATUS_BRB
        ZRQ_STATUS_BUSY
        ZRQ_STATUS_NOTATHOME
        ZRQ_STATUS_NOTATDESK
        ZRQ_STATUS_NOTINOFFICE  = 5
        ZRQ_STATUS_ONPHONE
        ZRQ_STATUS_ONVACATION
        ZRQ_STATUS_OUTTOLUNCH
        ZRQ_STATUS_STEPPEDOUT   = 9
        ZRQ_STATUS_INVISIBLE    = 12
        ZRQ_STATUS_CUSTOM       = 99
        ZRQ_STATUS_IDLE         = 999
        ZRQ_STATUS_OFFLINE      = 0x5a55aa56
        ZRQ_STATUS_TYPING       = 0x16

You may choose either AVAILABLE or INVISIBLE as your initial login status.  
TYPING is used only when sending a TYPING notification packet.


4. Session states

A Yahoo session has two states, Authentication and Messaging.

4.1. Authentication

The session starts in the authentication state.  The client sends the username
to the server.  The server responds with a challenge string.  The client
responds to this challenge with two response strings.  If authentication is 
successful, the connection goes into the messaging state, else, an error
response is sent back.

4.2. Messaging state

After successful authentication, the session goes into the messaging state.
The server sends the buddy list, ignore list, identity list and a list of
cookies to the client.  These might all be sent in a single packet.  It then
sends the list of online buddies along with their status codes.  All this is
sent without the client requesting anything.

At this time, any offline messages are also delivered to the client.

In the messaging state, a client may send/receive messages, join conferences,
send/receive files, change state, etc.

Messaging state is terminated when the user goes offline by sending a LOGOFF
packet.


5. Requests

5.1. Authentication

The first packet sent from the client is the authentication request 
packet.  This consists of the user's yahoo id, or any identity 
corresponding to that yahoo id.  The AUTH packet has one key/value pair.

	service: ZRQ_SERVICE_AUTH
	status:  ZRQ_STATUS_AVAILABLE

	1: yahoo_id

The server responds with a Challenge string.  The client then hashes the 
username and password with this challenge string, and sends it back as an 
AUTH_RESP packet.

	service: ZRQ_SERVICE_AUTHRESP
	status:  initial login status

	0: yahoo_id
	6: response_string_1
	96: response_string_2
	1: active_id


5.2. Sending a message

	service: ZRQ_SERVICE_MESSAGE
	status:  0

	0: yahoo_id
	1: active_id
	5: recipient_id
	14: message to send

5.3. Send typing start/stop notification

	service: ZRQ_SERVICE_NOTIFY
	status:  ZRQ_STATUS_TYPING

	4: active_id
	5: recipient_id
	13: 1 or 0 depending on whether this is a typing start or stop 
            packet
	14: <space>
	49: TYPING	/* The literal string */

5.4. Set status

	service: ZRQ_SERVICE_ISBACK or ZRQ_SERVICE_ISAWAY
	status:  the status to set to

	10: status_code
